# Benchmarking_RNASeq
This Benchmarking_RNASeq Repository contains the processing of 4 samples of ovarian cancer RNA-seq with 150bp paired-end reads, as well as 4 samples of REP-seq data, and 20 samples of ovarian cancer RNA-seq with 75 bp single-end reads.

Mixcr and Trust4 were run on the 4 samples of ovarian cancer RNA-seq with 150bp paired-end reads and the 20 samples of ovarian cancer RNA-seq with 75 bp single-end reads. Additionally, Mixcr for the REP-seq kit was run on the 4 samples of ovarian cancer REP-seq data.

This repository includes scripts (sh and ipynb) and outputs from the tools Mixcr, Trust4, Salmon, and xCell.
